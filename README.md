## Sales Data Analysis with SQL

### [Sales Data Analysis with SQL Project Link ](https://github.com/Bigfredoh/SQL-Projects/blob/main/Sales%20SQL.sql)

### Overview

This project involves the analysis of sales data using SQL, focusing on leveraging subqueries and window functions to gain valuable insights into customer behavior, product performance, and overall business trends. The dataset used in this project includes details about sales transactions such as order dates, customer information, product details, sales, quantity, discount, and profit.

Dataset
The dataset includes the following columns:

Order ID: Unique identifier for each order.

Order Date: Date the order was placed.

Ship Date: Date the order was shipped.

Lead Time: Time taken to ship the order.

Ship Mode: The shipping method used.

Customer ID: Unique identifier for each customer.

Segment: Customer segment (e.g., Consumer, Corporate).

Country, City: Location details of the customer.

Product ID: Unique identifier for each product.

Category, Sub-Category: Product category and sub-category.

Product Name: Name of the product.

Sales: The sales amount for the order.

Quantity: Number of units sold.

Discount: Discount applied to the order.

Profit: Profit earned from the order.

### Analysis Goals

1. Identify High-Value Customers: 
 Which customers have generated total sales above a certain threshold (e.g., $10,000)?

2. Determine the Most Profitable Product Categories:
 What are the top three most profitable product categories overall?

3. Analyze Shipping Performance:
What is the average lead time for orders that were shipped using "Second Class" or "Standard Class" modes?

4. Find Underperforming Products:
Which products have a negative average profit?

5. Segment-Based Profit Analysis:
How does the profit margin differ between customer segments (e.g., Consumer vs. Corporate)?

6. Identify the Most Discounted Products:
Which products have been sold with the highest average discount?

7. Calculate the Growth in Sales Over Time:
What is the month-over-month growth in sales?

8. Identify the Top 5 Customers by Profit:
Which customers generated the highest profit?

9. Analyze Product Performance by Region:
What are the top-performing products by sales in each country?

SQL Queries
The project contains SQL queries designed to answer the above analysis questions using subqueries and window functions. These queries are organized and commented to provide clarity on the logic and methodology used.
